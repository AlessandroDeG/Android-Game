# Android-Game

A game I developed as a project for an Android programming class during my Bachleor.

I's a game inspired by space impact/space invaders, in which the player can move the character using data from the gyroscope or accelerometer sensors, and can fire shots by touching the screen, in order to avoid, or destroy procedurally generated obstacles or collect points, depending on the type of object generated. These obstacles also include bonuses and animated boss characters that the player will have to face.

I had a lot of fun coding it!
